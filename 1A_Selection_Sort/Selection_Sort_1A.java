/*
    QUESTION :
        Sort a given set of n integer elements using Selection Sort method and compute its time complexity.
        Run the program for varied values of n> 5000 and record the time taken to sort. Plot a graph 
        of the time taken versus n. The elements can be read from a file or can be generated using
        the random number generator. Demonstrate using C++/Java how the brute force method works along
        with its time complexity analysis: worst case, average case and best case.

    OUTPUT :
